# Data-Science-Tasks
Tasks with different datasets and ML-approaches for education. 

There is you can find:
+ Linear models with searching hyperparameters by GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV
+ Data Analisys with PCA, TNSE approaches and other (correlation matrix etc). A lot of visualisation:)
+ Implementation of Tree-based models and hyperparameters optimization by hyperband library: https://github.com/mbogomazov/hyperband_multithreadin, which we 
modified and divided into threads to speed up optimization (improvements in search speed by almost 2 times)
+ Different models for classification
+ Unsupervised learning with DBSCAN, K-means, applying PCA

Also, 
mathematical and theoretical substantiation of models and approaches can be found in my term paper on the topic: "Algorithmic methods of parameter searching in ML".
